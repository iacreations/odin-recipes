    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
<li> 
    <li>
1 large egg, lightly beaten
</li> 
<li>
2 tablespoons minced seeded jalapeno pepper
</li> 
<li>
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
</li> 
<li>
1 teaspoon onion powder
</li> 
<li>
1 teaspoon ground ginger
</li> 
<li>
2 garlic cloves, peeled and pressed
</li> 
<li>
freshly ground black pepper to taste
</li> 
<li>
1 pound ground chicken
</li> 
<li>
1/2 cup plain panko breadcrumbs
</li>
<h4>Firecracker Sauce</h4>
 
<li>
1/2 cup hot sauce, such as Frank’s Red Hot® Buffalo Wing Sauce
</li> 
<li>
1/2 cup brown sugar
</li> 
<li>
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
</li> 
<li>
2 teaspoons cider vinegar
</li> 
<li>
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
</li>
<li> 
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
</li>
  </ul>

<h4>
  Directions
  </h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with foil, and lightly spray with cooking spray.
</li>
<li>
Ingredients arranged for a recipe including ground chicken breadcrumbs brown sugar and various seasonings
</li>
<li>
Stir egg, jalapeño, soy sauce, onion powder, ginger, garlic, and pepper together in a large bowl. Add ground chicken and breadcrumbs, and gently mix just until just combined.
</li>
<li>
Form into meatballs using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop; shape with wet hands. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
</li>
<li>
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
</li>
<li>
Meanwhile, for firecracker sauce, combine hot sauce, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire, and red pepper flakes in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat to cool. The sauce will thicken slightly as it cools.
</li>
<li>
Dip each meatball into sauce or brush each meatball with sauce, return to the baking sheet, and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.
</li>
<li>
Drizzle or brush with additional sauce as desired, sprinkle with chopped parsley, and serve. Serve remaining sauce on the side for dipping.
</li>
  </ol>
